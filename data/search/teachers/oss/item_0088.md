## Prompt
```
We now define an algorithm: The definition of a(n) is the number of possible decompositions of the polynomial $n * (x + x^2 + ... + x^q)$, where q > 1, into a sum of k polynomials, not necessarily all different; each of these polynomials is to be of the form $b_1 * x + b_2 * x^2 + ... + b_q * x^q$ where each b_i is one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., q and no two b_i are equal, and the coefficients of $x, x^2, ..., x^q $in each polynomial are drawn from distinct elements of a set of integers from 1 to q. Given the input x_list (a series of values): [83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92], determine the corresponding output sequence y_list.

F. [1, 12, 5, 3, 5, 7, 1, 15, 5, 4]
G. [1, 13, 5, 3, 6, 7, 1, 15, 6, 5]
H. [1, 14, 5, 2, 5, 7, 1, 15, 4, 5]
I. [1, 13, 5, 4, 5, 7, 1, 16, 5, 5]
